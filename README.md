# Image Segmentation using Lazy Snapping and K-Means Clustering
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates image segmentation techniques using two popular methods: Lazy Snapping and K-means clustering. The objective is to partition the images into meaningful segments based on pixel intensity similarities and user-defined masks. This notebook showcases how different values of K impact the segmentation quality and compares the results of both algorithms. 

## Features
- Image Segmentation: Segment images using Lazy Snapping and K-Means Clustering.
- Comparison of Segmentation Quality: Evaluate the impact of k values (2, 4, 8, 16) on segmentation.
- Visual Representation: Display the original and segmented images in a grid for easy comparison.
